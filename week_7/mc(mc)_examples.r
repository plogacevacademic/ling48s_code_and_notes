# Example 1:
# Simple Monte Carlo Simulation:
# Healthy eating: Let's say that Peter decided to eat healthy, and to that end he decided that he will eat a variety of foods in certain proportions.
# Potatoes: .5
# Selery: .1
# Carrots: .2
# Salad: .1
# Avocado: .1
#
# Peter am generally very forgetful, and always looses notes with a record of what he ate.
# He needs a different approach, and so he decides to to carry a card with the proportions of different foods he plans to eat.

# Example 2:
# Markov Chain Monte Carlo
# Peter goes shopping
